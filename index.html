    <h1>Face Recognition using CNN</h1>
    <p>Recognizing Human faces and predicting Who is this person? It is a classification problem i.e. classify the digital image of a human face against a database of faces and tell who exactly the person is. For this purpose I am using Celebrity Dataset. Implementation of a custom model that gives 99% accuracy on the test data.
